# Automated Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

An AI-powered attendance system that leverages facial recognition to automate and streamline the attendance process. Built using Python (client-side) and C (server-side), the system implements socket programming, file handling, and computer vision to securely transmit and store attendance records.

## System Architecture

### ðŸ”¹ Client Side (Python)
- Capture student images for registration
- Use Haar Cascade for face detection
- Recognize faces & mark attendance in CSV
- Send CSV attendance file to server via sockets

### ðŸ”¹ Server Side (C)
- Accept client connections using Winsock2 API
- Receive attendance file and store in structured format
